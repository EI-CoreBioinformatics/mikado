No emperor or empress can lead its nation without a trusty chancellor to help him or her in organising the bureaucracy. Daijin, the Japanese minister, has the same role in Mikado - it smooths the path to go from a collection of read inputs (both RNA-Seq or long reads) to a polished assembly. The pipeline is based on Snakemake_ [Snake]_ and supports natively three cluster management systems (SLURM, PBS and LSF), plus any DRMAA-compliant batch submission system.
