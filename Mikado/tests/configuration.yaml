    #  and any AS event. Default: 60%.

    #   Only transcripts with a score at least (best) * value are retained. Default:
    #  50% (0.5)
    #  - only_confirmed_introns: bring back AS events only when their introns are
    #  either
    #   present in the primary transcript or in the set of confirmed introns.

  chimera_split:
    #  Parameters related to the splitting of transcripts in the presence of
    #  two or more ORFs. Parameters:
    #  - execute: whether to split multi-ORF transcripts at all. Boolean.
    #  - blast_check: whether to use BLAST information to take a decision. See blast_params
    #  for details.
    #  - blast_params: Parameters related to which BLAST data we want to analyse.
    blast_check: true
    blast_params:
      #  Parameters for the BLAST check prior to splitting.
      #  - evalue: Minimum evalue for the whole hit. Default: 1e-6
      #  - leniency: One of STRINGENT, LENIENT, PERMISSIVE. Default: LENIENT
      #  - max_target_seqs: maximum number of hits to consider. Default: 3
      leniency: LENIENT
    execute: true
  files:
    #  Input and output files for Mikado pick.
    #  - gff: input GTF/GFF3 file. Default: mikado_prepared.gtf
    #  - loci_out: output GFF3 file from Mikado pick. Default: mikado.loci.gff3
    #  - subloci_out: optional GFF file with the intermediate subloci. Default: no
    #  output
    #  - monoloci_out: optional GFF file with the intermediate monoloci. Default:
    #  no output
    #  - log: log file for this step.
    input: mikado_prepared.gtf
  run_options:
    #  Generic run options.
    #  - purge: boolean flag. If set, all loci where all transcripts have a score
    #  of 0 will be excluded
    #    from the output. Default: false
    #  - remove_overlapping_fragments: boolean flag. If set, fragments (defined as
    #  monoexonic loci
    #    classified as P,x,i or p compared to another locus, will be removed from
    #  the output.
    #  - procs: number of processes to use. Default: 1
    #  - intron_range: A range where most of the introns (99%) should fall into. Transcripts
    #  with too many
    #   introns larger or smaller than what is defined in this range will be penalised
    #   in the scoring. Default: [60, 900]
    #  - preload: boolean flag. If set, the whole database will be preloaded into
    #  memory for potentially faster access.
    #  - single_thread: boolean flag. If set, multithreading will be disabled - useful
    #  for profiling and debugging.
    #  - flank: integer, maximum flank to group transcripts together for analysis.
    #  Default: 0.
    intron_range: [60, 90]
    procs: 1
    single_thread: false
  scoring_file: plant.yaml
prepare:
  #  Options related to the input data preparation.
  #  - procs: Number of processes to use.
  #  - strand_specific: if set to True, transcripts will be assumed to be in the correct
  #  orientation, no strand flipping or removal
  #  - strip_cds: Boolean. It indicates whether to remove the CDS from the predictions
  #  during preparation.

  #  of 0.1,
  #    on a 300bp sequence with an open ORF Mikado would look for an alternative in-frame
  #  start codon
  #    in the first 30 bps (10% of the cDNA).
