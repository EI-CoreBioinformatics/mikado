Mikado has greatly benefitted from the public libraries, in particular the [NetworkX]_ library, Scipy and Numpy ([Scipy]_, [Numpy]_), Intervaltree [PYinterval]_, and the BX library for a Cython implementation of interval trees. Mikado has also been constantly optimised using Snakeviz, a tool which proved invaluable during the development process.
