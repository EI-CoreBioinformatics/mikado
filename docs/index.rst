Mikado: pick your transcript
============================

Mikado is a lightweight Python3 pipeline to extract the best transcript models from multiple transcript assemblies. During execution, it will detect gene models by looking for genomic overlaps and shared introns; it will subsequently cluster transcript models into subloci, effectively creating seeds for the definition of gene loci.
Definition of what constitutes a "good" transcript is left to the experimenter, though pre-defined scoring files are included in the distributed software.
