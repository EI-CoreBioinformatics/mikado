Shanghai is a lightweight Python3 pipeline whose purpose is to facilitate the identification
of expressed loci from RNA-Seq data * and to select the best model in each locus.

The logic of the pipeline is as follows:

1. In a first step, the annotation (provided in GTF/GFF3 format) is parsed to locate *superloci* of overlapping features on the **same strand**.
2. The superloci are divided into different *subloci*, each of which is defined as follows:

    * For multiexonic transcripts, to belong to the same sublocus they must share at least a splicing junction (i.e. an intron)
    * For monoexonic transcripts, they must overlap for at least one base pair
    * All subloci must contain either only multiexonic or only monoexonic transcripts
3. In each sublocus, the pipeline selects the best transcript according to a user-defined prioritization scheme.
4. The resulting *monosubloci* are merged together, if applicable, into *monosubloci_holders*
5. The best non-overlapping transcripts are selected, in order to define the *loci* contained inside the superlocus.

    * At this stage, monoexonic and multiexonic transcript are checked for overlaps
    * Moreover, two multiexonic transcripts are considered to belong to the same locus if they share a splice *site* (not junction)

The resulting, cleaned file does contain therefore only one transcript per locus.
The criteria used to select the "*best*" transcript are left to the user's discretion.
